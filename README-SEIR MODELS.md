Stability Analysis Of SEIR Models On The Spread Of COVID-19 In DKI Jakarta With Vaccination
This study was aimed to explain the SEIR mathematical model and explained
stability of the equilibrium point of the SEIR model on the COVID-19 spreading in
DKI Jakarta with vaccination.

This study used data of COVID-19 cases in DKI Jakarta from 13th January
2021 untill 29th September 2021. The SEIR model used a differential equation
model in form of proportions. The model that had been formed was then carried out
by mathematical analysis and numerical simulation involving death or natural birth
(μ) parameter, the rate of susceptible individuals became exposed individuals after
interacting with infected individuals (β), the rate of exposed individuals becoming
infected individuals (σ), infected individuals rate became recovered individuals (γ),
and vaccination proportion rate (p). Where the β parameters and p are varied to
see the COVID-19-free equilibrium point and the COVID-19 endemic equilibrium
point.

The findings indicated that the SEIR model on the spread of COVID-19 in DKI
Jakarta with vaccination was in the form of a four-equation non-linear differential
equation system. According to numerical simulations, the value of the proportion
of vaccination ( p ) was increasing while the rate of susceptible individuals
becoming exposed individuals after contact with infected individuals (β) was
decreasing. As a result, a COVID-19 free equilibrium points with a basic
reproduction number (R0) ranging from 0.001 to 0.132 would exist. It indicated
that, on average, each infected individual would infect fewer than one new
individual, implying that COVID-19 will not spread. Whereas the value of the
proportion of vaccination (p ) was decreasing, the rate of susceptible people
becoming infected after contact with infected people (β) was increasing. Then
COVID-19 would reach an endemic equilibrium point with a basic reproductive
number (R0) of around 1.03 to 1.5, implying that each individual infected with
COVID-19 will infect one new individual, causing COVID-19 to spread and
become endemic. According to the SEIR modeling, it was needed to vaccinate with
a vaccination proportion range of 5.87 × 10−4 − 1.87 × 10−3to limit the rate of
transmission of COVID-19 in DKI Jakarta.
